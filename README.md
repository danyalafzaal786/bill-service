## ‚úÖ Run Tests
### Unit Tests
To run the unit tests, execute the following command:
```bash
mvn test
```
### Run with Coverage:
To generate test coverage reports using Jacoco, use the following:
```bash
mvn clean verify
```
or
```bash
mvn jacoco:report
```
### Generated Jacoco Report:
Once the tests are completed, a report will be generated in `target/site/jacoco/`. Open the `index.html` file to view the code coverage summary.
```bash
open target/site/jacoco/index.html  # On macOS or Linux
start target/site/jacoco/index.html  # On Windows
```

## üßº Code Quality
To run static code analysis and check for code style issues, use the following command:
```bash
# Run static analysis (Checkstyle)
mvn checkstyle:check
```
(Optional) To run a SonarQube scan for code quality, run:
```bash
# Run SonarQube scan (make sure SonarQube is running locally)
mvn sonar:sonar \
  -Dsonar.projectKey=billing-service \
  -Dsonar.host.url=http://localhost:9000 \
  -Dsonar.token=sonarqube-token
```
